Hey there! 👋 I'm **Angelo**, a Senior Machine Learning Researcher who spends his days teaching computers to look at teeth.

## What I Do (Mostly)

- Building AI for 3D dental imaging at [Promaton](https://www.promaton.com/), and, previously, radiology diagnostics at [Quantib](https://www.quantib.com/)
- PyTorch/TensorFlow wizardry on computer vision and generative stuff
- Co-authored work [on AI-designed vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50659-5) back in my [J&J](https://www.jnj.com/innovativemedicine/) days
- Authored [ISMRM abstract on triaging dense breast MR screening with CNNs](https://archive.ismrm.org/2020/0263.html)
- Co-authored patents in AI for dentistry

:::tip[Current Obsession]
Messing with LLMs, multimodal AI, and whatever shiny new tool can make science (or side projects) go faster.

## My Journey (Short Version)

[Polytechnic University of Milan](https://www.polimi.it/en/) grad → software dev → AI research. Now turning X-rays into smart insights, while hacking on fun stuff like retro LLM inference on ancient hardware.

## Beyond the Code (The Fun Bits)

When not staring at models training:

- 📚 Reading AI papers
- 🔧 Building silly side projects: [aDale.ink](https://medium.com/@angelo_zuffiano) (AI personalized kids' books), [Hirflow](https://www.hirflow.com/) (nagging people about unpaid invoices), and random C code on old PCs [RetroLM](https://github.com/agaz1985/retrolm)
- 🎯 Wondering if AI will save the world or just make better cat videos

:::note[My "Philosophy"]
AI is at its best when it empowers people to achieve great things
